A React component for rendering a `<a>` that uses *history* navigation for local URLs.

## API

```typescript
export interface LinkProps
  extends React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement> {
  // Unlike normal <a>, this property is required
  href: string
}
export const Link: React.FC<LinkProps>
```

## Basic

This component is the preferred method of navigation, alongside the **navigate** function.

This component takes all the same parameters as the built-in `<a>` tag. It's `onClick` will be extended to perform local navigation, and if it is inside a component returned from `useRoutes` it will have the provided `basePath` preprended to its `href`.

```jsx
<Link href="/foo">
  go to foo
</Link>
```
